# Hadamard + Hadamard

This sample shows that applying 2 Hadamard gates brings the qubit back into the state
it was in before applying the first Hadamard gate.

# Running the sample

To run this application, simply run
`mvn clean javafx:run`

There is no relevant console output, but the following circuit will be shown:

# What it is doing

This sample shows that the Hadamard gate is its own inverse. This is used in the next samples.

You can learn more about this sample in Chapter 8 of [Quantum Computing for Java Developers](https://www.manning.com/books/quantum-computing-for-java-developers?a_aid=quantumjava&a_bid=e5166ab9). It is discussed in 8.4.1: "Applying 2 Hadamard gates"
