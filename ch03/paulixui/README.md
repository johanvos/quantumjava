# PauliX - UI

This sample shows how to create and visualise a very basic quantum circuit
with Strange. It consists of a single qubit, and a single
gate (the Pauli-X gate) that is applied to that qubit.

# Running the sample

To run this application, simply run
`mvn clean javafx:run`

The expected outcome on the console looks like this:

```
Value = 1
```
Apart from this, the quantum circuit will also be rendered,
which results in the following image:

# What it is doing

This is doing exactly the same as the previous sample,
apart from the rendering that is now added.
