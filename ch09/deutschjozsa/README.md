# Deutsch Josza algoritm

This code demonstrates the Deutsch Jozsa algorithm

# Running the sample

To run this application, simply run
`mvn clean javafx:run`

The result of this application is similar to the output below
```
f = 1, val = 1
f = 1, val = 1
f = 1, val = 1
f = 1, val = 1
f = 1, val = 1
f = 1, val = 1
f = 1, val = 1
f = 1, val = 1
f = 1, val = 1
f = 1, val = 1
```

Also, the following quantum circuit is rendered:

# What it is doing

This sample shows how the Deutsch Jozsa algorithm works.

You can learn more about this sample in Chapter 9 of [Quantum Computing for Java Developers](https://www.manning.com/books/quantum-computing-for-java-developers?a_aid=quantumjava&a_bid=e5166ab9). It is discussed in 9.7: "Deutsch Jozsa algorithm".
