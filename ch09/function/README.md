# Constant and Balanced Functions

This code shows the difference between a constant and a balanced function

# Running the sample

To run this application, simply run
`mvn clean javafx:run`

The expected outcome on the console looks similar to this

```
f2 is a balanced function
f4 is a constant function
f2 is a balanced function
f2 is a balanced function
f3 is a balanced function
f3 is a balanced function
f4 is a constant function
f1 is a constant function
f2 is a balanced function
f1 is a constant function

```

# What it is doing

In this 100% classic sample, a number of constant and balanced functions are created. We need 2 evaluations
before we can determine a random function is contant or balanced.

You can learn more about this sample in Chapter 9 of [Quantum Computing for Java Developers](https://www.manning.com/books/quantum-computing-for-java-developers?a_aid=quantumjava&a_bid=e5166ab9). It is discussed in 9.2: "Properties of functions"
