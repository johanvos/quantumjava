# Reversible gates

This sample demonstrates what a reversible gate is

# Running the sample

To run this application, simply run
`mvn clean javafx:run`

The result of this application is a user interface showing the circuit and the probabilities:

# What it is doing

This sample shows that an initial state of 25% chance to measure 0 results in a similar state 
after applying 2 NOT gates.

You can learn more about this sample in Chapter 9 of [Quantum Computing for Java Developers](https://www.manning.com/books/quantum-computing-for-java-developers?a_aid=quantumjava&a_bid=e5166ab9). It is discussed in 9.3: "Reversible quantum gates".
