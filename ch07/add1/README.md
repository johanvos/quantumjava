# Quantum adder

This sample demonstrates a circuit for adding 2 qubits

# Running the sample

To run this application, simply run
`mvn clean javafx:run`

The expected outcome on the console looks like this:

```
Adding 0 + 0 = 0
Adding 0 + 1 = 1
Adding 1 + 0 = 1
Adding 1 + 1 = 0
```

# What it is doing

This sample contains a circuit that a developer can create and modify.
The goal of this simple circuit is to build a quantum adder that adds
2 qubits.

You can learn more about this sample in Chapter 7 of [Quantum Computing for Java Developers](https://www.manning.com/books/quantum-computing-for-java-developers?a_aid=quantumjava&a_bid=e5166ab9). It is discussed in 7.6.2: "Adding two qubits"
