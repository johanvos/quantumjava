# RandomBit

This sample mainly demonstrates the rendering of a circuit using StrangeFX.

# Running the sample

To run this application, simply run
`mvn clean javafx:run`

The expected outcome on the console looks like this:

```
Qubit[0]: 1
Qubit[1]: 1
Qubit[2]: 0
Qubit[3]: 1
```

The most important part of the sample though is the visualisation
of the quantum circuit, as shown below:

# What it is doing

The main purpose of this sample is to explain how StrangeFX visualises a
quantum circuit that you created using Strange.

You can learn more about this sample in Chapter 7 of [Quantum Computing for Java Developers](https://www.manning.com/books/quantum-computing-for-java-developers?a_aid=quantumjava&a_bid=e5166ab9). It is discussed in 7.5.1: "Visualisation of circuits"
